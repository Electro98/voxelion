# Voxelion

This is my humble attempt on creating my own voxel renderer!

## Build
### Generating project files

You need to run premake to generate project files for your system:
```shell
# Linux
./Scripts/Setup-Linux.sh

# Windows
./Scripts/Setup-Windows.bat
```
By default Linux build uses make with clang and Windows build creates a Visual Studio 2022 project file.

### Linux

Building project as simple as that:
```shell
make
```
...and running freshly built binary after that.
